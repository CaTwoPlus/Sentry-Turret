 * Disclaimer:
 * This is a modified version of Mark Alexander Barros's Arduino Portal Turret - (v 1.0) source file, mainly used to write my own custom application 
 * for serial communications practice, with C++, as kind of a boot camp project. With the modifications I made, sound is played back through the computer's speakers, 
 * the Adafruit Wave Shield module is no longer needed, and running a Windows application while having the Arduino board plugged in is sufficient. I used my own mix 
 * of sound files as well, and planning to implement features like an additional servo, motion tracking, more user interactions (ability to pick up the turret, 
 * tilt it to the side so it shuts down) and more. Current version of this adaptation is v 0.5. 
 * 
 * Issues: 
 * I use a SG90 micro servo, with the Servo.h library, and servo jittering is an issue for me. There are techniques of course for reducing the jitter, like getting rid
 * of Arduino runtime and writing your own for better PWM signal resolution, limiting the servo's min and max range by a few degrees, detaching the servo after each 
 * increment of movement and so on. Improvements in this aspect may come with a future update.

 * 
 * In terms of parts, I used a 9V adapter, and a buck converter for powering the servo. Instead of a ping sensor, I used two HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensors. 
 * The turret frame is a pan/tilt camera platform.
