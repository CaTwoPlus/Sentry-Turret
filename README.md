# Sentry-Turret
This application reads output from an Arduino board through serial communication, and plays back sound files on Windows. 

The name of the repository comes from the Portal video game series, as the sound files I used in the project are emitted by Sentry Turret NPCs. 

This is one of my C++ bootcamp projects, and most of the information about how to write apps like this one is available all over internet. A great resource is the official Microsoft Win32 API documentation. 

I included a separate license file as well, since the Arduino project is an adaptation, and the original project came with Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0.

If you are interested in which parts are required to create your own mini Sentry Turret, please check the License.txt file.
